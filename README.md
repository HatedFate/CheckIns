Just a simple program to calculate an employee's hours of work in a month.

**IMPORTANT**
I have not change the path of my program and I do not have to time to make a program to change it for you guys. I have a lot of homework this week, so I highly suggest editing the path to your own preference.

ALSO:
- MAKE SURE TO DOWNLOAD SQLITE3
- MAKE SURE TO DOWNLOAD PYTZ
